## Exercise 1.1

Brainstorm a list of 15 or so items which you would classify as mental phenomena or states. Try to think fo a wide variety of examples--it will greatly help if you do this exercise with two or three other people.

My answer:

> joy, satisfaction, anger, jealousy, fear, tiredness, alertness, sleeping, concentration, confusion, regret, love, lust, learning, rationalizing.

Book answer:

> pains, itches, dreaming, thinking, hallucinating, seeing, hearing, jealously, hoping, depression, joy, believing, wanting, remembering, consciousness, indignation, understanding, acting, intending, conceiving, fear, wishing, regretting, imagining, tickles, throbs, tasting, aches, smelling, seeing in the mind's eye, trying, anticipating, grief, enjoyment, tingles, knowing, reasoning.

## Exercise 1.2

Look through the examples of mental states given above and see if you can find ways of classifying them into different groupings. For examples, some name sensations, such as pains and itches, whilst others name emotions and yet other are more intellectual, such as thinking and understanding. Again, do this exercise with two or three other people and then compare your results with mine.

My answer:

> 1. **Sensations**: pains, itches, seeing, hearing, consciousness, tickles, throbs, tasting, aches, smelling, anticipating, tingles.
> 1. **Mental Work**: dreaming, thinking, hallucinating, wanting, remembering, understanding, acting, intending, conceiving, imagining, seeing in the mind's eye, trying, knowing, reasoning.
> 1. **Feelings**: jealously, hoping, depression, joy, believing, indignation, fear, wishing, regretting, grief, enjoyment.

Book answer:

> 1. **Sensations**: pains, aches, tickles,itches, throbs, tingles.
> 1. **Cognitions**: believing, knowing, understanding, conceiving, thinking, reasoning.
> 1. **Emotions**: fear, jealousy, envy, anger, grief, indignation, enjoyment.
> 1. **Perceptions**: seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching.
> 1. **Quasi-perceptual states**: dreaming, imagining, seeing in the mind's eye, hallucinating, seeing after-images
> 1. **Conative states**: acting, trying, wanting, intending, wishing.

## Exercise 1.3

If my coins are in my purse, and my purse is in my pocket, does it follow that my coins are in my pocket?

My answer:

> Yes, because then the pocket contains both the purse and the coins. It is simply that these coins, which are in my pocket, are located within the purse, which is in my pocket.

Book answer:

> In one sense, my coins are not in my pocket, i.e. not loose in my pocket, since they are contained in the purse. But clearly, if the purse is in the space bounded by the sides and bottom of the pocket, and the coins are in the space bounded by the material comprising the purse, then the coins are in my pocket. The location of the coins is a literal location in space and one could reach into the pocket and take them out. The same is true, naturally, of bodily organs and parts of the body. The heart and nerves, for example ,clearly do have literal locations within the body and could be removed from it.

## Exercise 1.4

If my pain is in my foot, and my foot is in my shoe, does it follow that my pain is in my shoe? This is a much more complicated case than that in Exercise 1.3.

My answer:

> I *don't* think it is reasonable to say that the pain is 'in' the shoe. To say that pain is 'in' somewhere is (to me) different from the coins in that the coins could exist outside the purse and just in the pocket. This is not the same case for pain. In a sense, pain (and likely other sensations) are parasitic; they require a host to exist. Pain cannot leave the foot and travel *into* the shoe, so the shoe does not 'contain' the pain.
