# Chapter 1

## Exercise 1.1

Brainstorm a list of 15 or so items which you would classify as mental phenomena or states. Try to think fo a wide variety of examples--it will greatly help if you do this exercise with two or three other people.

My answer:

> joy, satisfaction, anger, jealousy, fear, tiredness, alertness, sleeping, concentration, confusion, regret, love, lust, learning, rationalizing.

Book answer:

> pains, itches, dreaming, thinking, hallucinating, seeing, hearing, jealously, hoping, depression, joy, believing, wanting, remembering, consciousness, indignation, understanding, acting, intending, conceiving, fear, wishing, regretting, imagining, tickles, throbs, tasting, aches, smelling, seeing in the mind's eye, trying, anticipating, grief, enjoyment, tingles, knowing, reasoning.

## Exercise 1.2

Look through the examples of mental states given above and see if you can find ways of classifying them into different groupings. For examples, some name sensations, such as pains and itches, whilst others name emotions and yet other are more intellectual, such as thinking and understanding. Again, do this exercise with two or three other people and then compare your results with mine.

My answer:

> 1. **Sensations**: pains, itches, seeing, hearing, consciousness, tickles, throbs, tasting, aches, smelling, anticipating, tingles.
> 1. **Mental Work**: dreaming, thinking, hallucinating, wanting, remembering, understanding, acting, intending, conceiving, imagining, seeing in the mind's eye, trying, knowing, reasoning.
> 1. **Feelings**: jealously, hoping, depression, joy, believing, indignation, fear, wishing, regretting, grief, enjoyment.

Book answer:

> 1. **Sensations**: pains, aches, tickles,itches, throbs, tingles.
> 1. **Cognitions**: believing, knowing, understanding, conceiving, thinking, reasoning.
> 1. **Emotions**: fear, jealousy, envy, anger, grief, indignation, enjoyment.
> 1. **Perceptions**: seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching.
> 1. **Quasi-perceptual states**: dreaming, imagining, seeing in the mind's eye, hallucinating, seeing after-images
> 1. **Conative states**: acting, trying, wanting, intending, wishing.

## Exercise 1.3

If my coins are in my purse, and my purse is in my pocket, does it follow that my coins are in my pocket?

My answer:

> Yes, because then the pocket contains both the purse and the coins. It is simply that these coins, which are in my pocket, are located within the purse, which is in my pocket.

Book answer:

> In one sense, my coins are not in my pocket, i.e. not loose in my pocket, since they are contained in the purse. But clearly, if the purse is in the space bounded by the sides and bottom of the pocket, and the coins are in the space bounded by the material comprising the purse, then the coins are in my pocket. The location of the coins is a literal location in space and one could reach into the pocket and take them out. The same is true, naturally, of bodily organs and parts of the body. The heart and nerves, for example, clearly do have literal locations within the body and could be removed from it.

## Exercise 1.4

If my pain is in my foot, and my foot is in my shoe, does it follow that my pain is in my shoe? This is a much more complicated case than that in Exercise 1.3.

My answer:

> I *don't* think it is reasonable to say that the pain is 'in' the shoe. To say that pain is 'in' somewhere is (to me) different from the coins in that the coins could exist outside the purse and just in the pocket. This is not the same case for pain. In a sense, pain (and likely other sensations) are parasitic; they require a host to exist. Pain cannot leave the foot and travel *into* the shoe, so the shoe does not 'contain' the pain.

## Exercise 1.5

Can you think of an objection to the claim that things other than mental states, such as words, exhibit intentionality? Working on your own or with someone else, write down your objection.

My answer:

> Many things, such as books or other writing, symbols, games, music, etc. only have meaning when someone is actively reading or deriving the meaning, through their experience and intentionality. When there is no one or nothing left that has the ability to understand such a thing, it has no ability to enforce intentionality. Thus, the only intentionality that the object may seem to have is actually from the one who is observing the object.

## Exercise 1.6

Is what is true of brains equally true of minds? How do I find out what is taking place in my mind as opposed to what is occurring in yours? Are there any obstacles to discovering what you are thinking and feeling compared with by begin able to say what I myself am thinking and feeling? Think about this for a few minutes and if possible discuss it with someone else.

My answer:

> The brain has two hemispheres. Would it be reasonable to then claim that the mind has two hemispheres? I don't think so. So not everything that is true of the brain is equally true of the mind.
> To find out what is taking place in my mind, I communicate in thoughts to myself. To find out what is taking place in someone else's brain, their thoughts must be scrunched down into the limits of sentences and verbal expressions.
> It would appear then that many thoughts are more than what they are able to be expressed, not matter how many sentences or expression that are use to describe them. This seems much similar to the common saying 'a picture is worth a thousand words'.

## Exercise 1.7

How convincing do you find the claim that a person has a privileged access to his or her own mental states, and to what extent do you agree that persons's knowledge of his or her own mental states is infallible?

My answer:

> I am not entirely convinced. The reason for this is that I have had experience of someone acting in a certain way. I understood the reason they might be acting in such a way, but it seemed that they were not, until I informed them of the reason that I believed they acted in that way. So it seemed that I somehow had more knowledge than they did of their intentionality of an action, and they were not aware of an intentionality of their action.

## 1.8 First- and third-person perspectives and the search for a unitary account of the mind

> "The fact that mental states may be ascribed in two fundamentally different kinds of way, from a first-person perspectives on the basis of inner awareness and from a third-person perspective grounded in the observation of behavior, has been through by some philosophers to raise problems." - Maslin

**Cartesianism** "leads to the view that states of mind are intrinsically inner, private and non-physical in nature, accessible only to the person whose states of mind they are."

**Analytical Behaviorism** "attempts to reduce mental states to patterns of actual and possible external public behavior."

## 1.9 The holistic character of intentional states and their relation to consciousness

> "Sensations are atomistic: the occurrence of an individual sensation has no implications for the existence, or non-existence, of any other sensation, so in this sense sensations can exist loosely and separately apart from each other." - Maslin

> " The capacity for intentional states to fit together to form a harmonious whole, or to be inconsistent with each toher, as well as to presuppose and entail the existence of other intentional states, is what philosophers refer to as their *holistic character*." - Maslin

## Exercise 1.10

In the light of th extended discussion comprising this chapter, do you think it is possible to state those conditions that will demarcate the mental from the non-mental? Are some elements of this criterion more basic than others? Try briefly to say what is distinctive about hte mental as opposed to the non-mental and then read my discussion below.

My answer:

> I think that one thing that demarcates the mental from the non-mental is intentionality. Things that do not have a mental state seem to not have intentionality, especially not *intentionality through time*. Another thing that demarcates the mental from the non-mental is the experience of emotions and sensations. Something that has no mental has no emotions or sensations, while something that is mental does.

Book answer:

> Firstly, physical things, and perhaps abstract entities such as numbers, can exist whether anyone is aware of them or not. By contrast sensations such as pains and itches exist if, and only if, a person or being is currently conscious of them. [...] Consciousness is also vitally important for ensuring coherence among the propositional attitudes which comprise non-sensational intentional states, because unless a person can become aware of the propositional attitudes to which they subscribe, they will not be able to detect and eliminate any inconsistencies between them. [...] Thirdly, physical phenomena are accessible only from a third-person perspective, whereas mental states can be accessed, and scribed from both first-person - 'inner' - and third-person 'outer' viewpoints. [...]
