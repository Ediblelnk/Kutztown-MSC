# Chapter 4: Analytical Behaviorism

## Exercise 4.1

I want to provide an analysis of the concept of a cause, to explain what it means to talk of cause and effect, and accordingly, I offer the following formula: 'A is the cause of B' is to be analyzed as 'B happens because of A'. Can you see why this attempted analysis will not do?

My answer:

> This answer won't do because it is just a rephrasing of the definition; there is no elaboration, and the definition is circular. What does it mean when 'B happens because of A'? The definition does not reveal anything.

## Exercise 4.2

Consider, firstly the statements (a) 'Martin raised his arm' and (b) 'Martin's arm went up.' These are not equivalent in meaning. Can you see the difference in meaning between these two statements?

My answer:

> The difference in meaning is that (b) does not attribute any actions to the choice of Martin. Sentence (a) presumes a sense of intentionality, decision-making, and purpose of mind. (b), by contrast, does not imply that Martin chose to raise his arm. Someone else might have raised it, or it may have gone up because of a spasm.

## Exercise 4.3

Can you see what mode of description Hempel must choose for his behavioral analysis and why? Give reasons for your decision.

Book answer:

> At the risk of importing circularity into his proposed analysis, Hempel must confine himself to using descriptions of colorless bodily movements. This would also accord with his avowed aim of reducing psychology to physics. In line with this, Hempel wrote: 'We see clearly that the meaning of psychological statements consists solely in the function of abbreviating the description of certain modes of physical response characteristic of the bodies of men and animals.'

## Exercise 4.4

Can you see the threat posed by the multiple realizability of actions to teh behavioral analysis of mental states?

My answer:

> If we are using physical actions to describe mental states in their entirety, but a mental state may correlate to different realizations of a physical state, how it is possible to even describe a consistent correlation between the two. This holds especially true if multiple mental states can be expressed by the same physical realization.

Book answer:

> The threat suggested in Exercise 4.4 is that the analysis could never be carried through to completion.

## Exercise 4.5

How plausive do you find Ryle's claim that having a disposition consists simply in a set of hypothetical 'if...then...' statements being true, providing the appropriate conditions are realized? Consider your response and discuss it with someone else before reading my comments.

My answer:

> I find that this claim actually does explain plenty of dispositions, in particular beliefs, desires, wants, and such. However, as for some of the more experiential dispositions, I am not fully convinced. If I am for instance confused, how does that fit into a 'if...then...' statement?

Book answer:

> most philosophers would now agree that there is more to a disposition than what Ryle claims it to be. The reason that glass has a disposition to break when struck -- the explanation of its brittleness -- is to be found in facts about its underlying micro-structure. If the micro-structure were to be altered in an appropriate manner, as when glass is annealed, then its tendency to shatter when struck is much reduced, or even removed, as in the case of toughened glass. By parity of argument, to have a belief (or any other mental state) is not merely to be inclined to behave in a certain way, but to be in an inner state, which may in the appropriate circumstances, manifest itself in outward behavior. However, once the propriety of thinking of beliefs and other mental states as inner causes of outward behavior has been allowed, behaviorism has been abandoned.

### Putnam Reference

> The point was well made by Hilary Putnam when writing about what we mean when we attribute a disease such as multiple sclerosis to someone. It is plausible to say that 'Normally people who have multiple sclerosis have some or all of the following symptoms' is a necessary (analytic) truth. In other words, it is part of what we mean by 'multiple sclerosis' that normally it gives rise to certain symptoms. But, it must be emphasized, this does not mean that talk about the disease, multiple sclerosis, can be translated, without loss of meaning, into talk about hte symptoms of multiple sclerosis. This would be analogous to the error the analytical behaviorists make when they try to render talk about 'pain' in terms of actual and potential pain-behavior. The error that underpins both these attempts is the mistake of trying to make *causes* logical construction out of their *effects*. But pains and diseases are causes of behavior and symptoms respectively, and cannot be reduced to, and constructed out of, their effects."
