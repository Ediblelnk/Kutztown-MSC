# Chapter 4: Analytical Behaviorism

## Exercise 4.1

I want to provide an analysis of the concept of a cause, to explain what it means to talk of cause and effect, and accordingly, I offer the following formula: 'A is the cause of B' is to be analyzed as 'B happens because of A'. Can you see why this attempted analysis will not do?

My answer:

> This answer won't do because it is just a rephrasing of the definition; there is no elaboration, and the definition is circular. What does it mean when 'B happens because of A'? The definition does not reveal anything.

## Exercise 4.2

Consider, firstly the statements (a) 'Martin raised his arm' and (b) 'Martin's arm went up.' These are not equivalent in meaning. Can you see the difference in meaning between these two statements?

My answer:

> The difference in meaning is that (b) does not attribute any actions to the choice of Martin. Sentence (a) presumes a sense of intentionality, decision-making, and purpose of mind. (b), by contrast, does not imply that Martin chose to raise his arm. Someone else might have raised it, or it may have gone up because of a spasm.

## Exercise 4.3

Can you see what mode of description Hempel must choose for his behavioral analysis and why? Give reasons for your decision.

Book answer:

> At the risk of importing circularity into his proposed analysis, Hempel must confine himself to using descriptions of colorless bodily movements. This would also accord with his avowed aim of reducing psychology to physics. In line with this, Hempel wrote: 'We see clearly that the meaning of psychological statements consists solely in the function of abbreviating the description of certain modes of physical response characteristic of the bodies of men and animals.'

## Exercise 4.4

Can you see the threat posed by the multiple realizability of actions to teh behavioral analysis of mental states?

My answer:

> If we are using physical actions to describe mental states in their entirety, but a mental state may correlate to different realizations of a physical state, how it is possible to even describe a consistent correlation between the two. This holds especially true if multiple mental states can be expressed by the same physical realization.

Book answer:

> The threat suggested in Exercise 4.4 is that the analysis could never be carried through to completion.

## Exercise 4.5

How plausive do you find Ryle's claim that having a disposition consists simply in a set of hypothetical 'if...then...' statements being true, providing the appropriate conditions are realized? Consider your response and discuss it with someone else before reading my comments.

My answer:

> I find that this claim actually does explain plenty of dispositions, in particular beliefs, desires, wants, and such. However, as for some of the more experiential dispositions, I am not fully convinced. If I am for instance confused, how does that fit into a 'if...then...' statement?

Book answer:

> most philosophers would now agree that there is more to a disposition than what Ryle claims it to be. The reason that glass has a disposition to break when struck -- the explanation of its brittleness -- is to be found in facts about its underlying micro-structure. If the micro-structure were to be altered in an appropriate manner, as when glass is annealed, then its tendency to shatter when struck is much reduced, or even removed, as in the case of toughened glass. By parity of argument, to have a belief (or any other mental state) is not merely to be inclined to behave in a certain way, but to be in an inner state, which may in the appropriate circumstances, manifest itself in outward behavior. However, once the propriety of thinking of beliefs and other mental states as inner causes of outward behavior has been allowed, behaviorism has been abandoned.

### Putnam Reference

> The point was well made by Hilary Putnam when writing about what we mean when we attribute a disease such as multiple sclerosis to someone. It is plausible to say that 'Normally people who have multiple sclerosis have some or all of the following symptoms' is a necessary (analytic) truth. In other words, it is part of what we mean by 'multiple sclerosis' that normally it gives rise to certain symptoms. But, it must be emphasized, this does not mean that talk about the disease, multiple sclerosis, can be translated, without loss of meaning, into talk about hte symptoms of multiple sclerosis. This would be analogous to the error the analytical behaviorists make when they try to render talk about 'pain' in terms of actual and potential pain-behavior. The error that underpins both these attempts is the mistake of trying to make *causes* logical construction out of their *effects*. But pains and diseases are causes of behavior and symptoms respectively, and cannot be reduced to, and constructed out of, their effects."

## Exercise 4.6

> "[A] person picturing his nursery is, in a certain way, like that person seeing his nursery, bu the similarity does not consists in his really looking at a real likeness of his nursery, but in his seeming to see his nursery itself, when he is not really seeing it. He is not being a spectator of a resemblance of his nursery, but he is resembling a spectator of his nursery" - Ryle

How plausible do you find Ryle's account of what it is to picture one's nursery to oneself? What criticisms can you make of this account?

My answer:

> When I imagine something in my head, and notice the phrasing with that, I picture it as literally inside my head, not as Ryle describes it. Ryle describes it as imagining being someone who is looking at that thing. This is external, whereas the way that I feel visualization happening is internal.

Book answer:

> What Ryle is maintaining is thin and unconvincing. To begin with, how could I resemble a spectator of my nursery if I were laying in bed, undressed, in the dark, engaging in a spot of nostalgia, by visualizing my nursery to myself? Besides, as I have already remarked, the experience of visualizing my nursery is a prime example of the sort of case where we would want to say that a private episode of consciousness, not capture-able in terms of outward public behavior, is integrally involved.

### Putnam Reference 2

Hilary Putnam has devised the following thought-experiment to provide a convincing case for this possibility. We are to imagine a race of super-Spartans or super-Stoics who constitute a community in which the adults have the ability to suppress successfully all involuntary pain-behavior. Although they sometimes admit that they are in pain, they always do this in calm, well-modulated voice, even if they are suffering hte torments of the damned. Neither do they groan, scream, wince, sweat nor grit their teeth. They admit it take a great effort of will to do this, but they have important ideological reasons for behaving in the way they do, and they undergo years of training to achieve the right standard of behavior in the face of pain. It might be argued that hte lack of pain-behavior will only be found in adults who have been suitably conditioned, and that non-adults will exhibit unconditioned pain-reactions, thus giving the ascription of mental states to the community a toehold. However, in response to this objection Putnam elaborates the fantasy further. We are to suppose that after several millions of years, the super-Spartans begin having children who are born fully acculturated, speaking the adult language, sharing opinions about their society and the beliefs about not giving any signs that one is in pain, unless it is by verbal report in a calm un-anxious and unconcerned manner. There are, then, no unconditioned pain-responses in this community, yet it would be crazy to take the position that because there is a total absence of natural, unconditioned pain-behavior, the super-Spartans cannot have the capacity for experiencing pain to them.

Putnam also asks us to imagine super-super-Spartans, who inhabit the X-world. These people have been super-Sparts for so long that not only do they not evince unconditioned pain-behavior, but they have begun to suppress all talk about pain. X-worlders do not admit to having pains, and pretend not to know either the word 'pain', or the experience to which it refers to. Nevertheless, they do have pains and know that they do. Putnam concludes:

> If this last fantasy is not, in some disguised way, self-contradictory, then logical behaviorism is simply a mistake. Not only is the second thesis of logical behaviorism -- the existence of a near-translation of pain into behavior talk -- false, but so is even the first thesis -- the existence of 'analytic entailments'. Pains are responsible for certain kinds of behavior -- but only in the context of our beliefs, desires, ideological attitudes, and so forth. From the statement 'X has a pain' by itself no behavioral statement follows -- not even a behavior statement with a 'normally' or a 'probably' in it.
