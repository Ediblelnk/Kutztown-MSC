# Chapter 4: Analytical Behaviorism

## Exercise 4.1

I want to provide an analysis of the concept of a cause, to explain what it means to talk of cause and effect, and accordingly, I offer the following formula: 'A is the cause of B' is to be analyzed as 'B happens because of A'. Can you see why this attempted analysis will not do?

My answer:

> This answer won't do because it is just a rephrasing of the definition; there is no elaboration, and the definition is circular. What does it mean when 'B happens because of A'? The definition does not reveal anything.

## Exercise 4.2

Consider, firstly the statements (a) 'Martin raised his arm' and (b) 'Martin's arm went up.' These are not equivalent in meaning. Can you see the difference in meaning between these two statements?

My answer:

> The difference in meaning is that (b) does not attribute any actions to the choice of Martin. Sentence (a) presumes a sense of intentionality, decision-making, and purpose of mind. (b), by contrast, does not imply that Martin chose to raise his arm. Someone else might have raised it, or it may have gone up because of a spasm.

## Exercise 4.3

Can you see what mode of description Hempel must choose for his behavioral analysis and why? Give reasons for your decision.

Book answer:

> At the risk of importing circularity into his proposed analysis, Hempel must confine himself to using descriptions of colorless bodily movements. This would also accord with his avowed aim of reducing psychology to physics. In line with this, Hempel wrote: 'We see clearly that the meaning of psychological statements consists solely in the function of abbreviating the description of certain modes of physical response characteristic of the bodies of men and animals.'

## Exercise 4.4

Can you see the threat posed by the multiple realizability of actions to teh behavioral analysis of mental states?

My answer:

> If we are using physical actions to describe mental states in their entirety, but a mental state may correlate to different realizations of a physical state, how it is possible to even describe a consistent correlation between the two. This holds especially true if multiple mental states can be expressed by the same physical realization.

Book answer:

> The threat suggested in Exercise 4.4 is that the analysis could never be carried through to completion.
