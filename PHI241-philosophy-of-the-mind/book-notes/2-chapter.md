# Chapter 2: Dualism

## Exercise 2.1

There is only one reliable way in which, just be examining the argument, you can be quite sure that the conclusion has to be true. What conditions, do you think, have to be met?

My answer:

> Firstly, all of the propositions must be true. If the foundation of the argument is made on something that is not true, there is no reason to expect the conclusion of these foundations to suddenly become true. Secondly, the relationship between the propositions must have logical reason. The foundations of the argument must be placed in particular orientation in order to logically fit together and build upon.

## Exercise 2.2

"The argument may be stated more formally and runs briefly thus:

1. The user of a thing and the thing used are two numerically different and distinct things, i.e. two logical substances.
1. A person uses his or her body.
1. Therefore a person must be numerically different and distinct from his or her own body.

But if a person is different from his or her body, he or she must be a non-bodily logical substance, i.e. a soul."

What criticisms can you make of the argument above? Working alone, write them down, and then discuss the issue with someone else.

My answer:

> Premise one has the issue of generalization upon only a limited set of examples. It is possible that there are examples that were not stated that might disprove that the user of a thing and the thing used are two numerically different and distinct things. Furthermore, premise two seems to only focus on one part of a person. A person also feel, for example, pain. If a person is distinct from his body, how can he know that his body is in pain from a third-person perspective?

## Exercise 2.3

1. Expressions that refer to persons and expressions that refer to people's bodies are not equivalent in meaning.
1. When one expression has a different meaning from another expression, this can *only* be because those expressions refer to, or name, different and distinct logical substances.
1. Therefore, persons must be logical substances, which are different and distinct from their bodies.

Are both the premises in the argument true or can either or both be rejected? Decide whether the premises are true or false and write down your reasons. Then discuss the issue with someone else, before reading on.

My answer, with help from the book:

> I see no reason to believe that the first premise is false. When we say someone is weak, we could either mean their physical body, or their mind. These are two different meanings. As for the second premise, it is false. Consider the phrase "I saw Patrick last night", versus "I saw Patrick's body last night." One implies that Patrick is dead, while the other does not. The conative meaning between these two ideas are different, but they are referring to the same material.

## Cartesian dualism

> "To summarize, for Descartes the soul is conscious, but incapable of extensions, whereas the body, and matter in general, is extended but intrinsically incapable of consciousness and mentality." - Maslin

## Exercise 2.4

How convincing do you find Descartes' two tests to establish dualism? Is there any reason, do you think, to suppose that human linguistic ability and range and adaptability of behavioral output and response can only be explained by postulating the presence of a soul? Write down your reasons, and after discussion with someone else, read on.

My answer:

> I find it naive to think that just because an organism lacks the ability to express its thoughts, does not mean that such thoughts do not exist. As for the second test, there is a case of dolphins learning two signs: the first means "do something that you have not done before", while the second is "do something you have no done before with someone else". The Dolphins are able to consistently follow these commands, which requires knowledge of what they have done before, and how to communicate something that has never been done to another entity (another dolphin).

## Exercise 2.5

Descartes exercises considerable ingenuity in describing a mechanism by means of which the non-extended, non-physical soul can affect the extended physical body, and be affected by it in turn. But can you see a problem with his account? Think about this on your own and then discuss it with another person.

My answer:

> If the non-physical soul is able to influence the physical world, even as Descartes describes as "a tiny push which is magnified by a chain pf physical causes and effects...", then there must be a physical part of the soul, from which it is able to interact with the physical world. There is no way for a completely non-physical soul to impact the completely physical world.
