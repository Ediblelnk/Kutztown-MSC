# Chapter 3: The Mind/Brain Identity Theory

## Exercise 3.1

Try applying the symmetry of identity to the mind/brain identity theory. What result do you get? What do you think its significance is?

My answer:

> When I apply the phrasing that mental states are brain states, there is no confusing or contradicting part of that phrase. However, when I apply the phrasing that brain states are mental states, we run into an issue. How do mental states *cause* brain states to show? Is there a clear way or route for this to occur? Where do the mental states affect in the brain in order to cause brain states? We run into the same problem that we did for Dualism.

Book answer:

> The upshot is that you cannot say that mental states are really only processes (really, truly) but that brain processes are not really mental states. To make this claim privileges the physical over the mental without justification. What it does, in effect, is to get rid of mental features in favor of brain features. It claims, effectively, that at the end of the day, there are only brain features.

## Exercise 3.2

Given the symmetry of identity and its neutrality regarding both halves of the identity statement, what stream of events should be accept into our ontology: physical or mental? What are the reasons for your choice?

Book answer:

> Evolution gives us a reason for privileging the physical. It seems reasonable to suppose that when the universe was first formed, there were no minds around but just particles whirling in space. After the planets had coalesced and the nuclear furnaces of the suns were lit, life gradually evolved. Eventually, after a certain level of physical complexity had been reached, mentality made its appearance.

## Exercise 3.3

1. Intentional mental states represent, or are about, states of affairs external to themselves, including states of affairs that do not -- and perhaps never did -- exist. For example, beliefs, desires, dreams, intentions, emotions, hopes, thoughts, as well as many other mental states, possess a representational content.
1. No brain state can possess a representational content.
1. Therefore intentional mental states cannot be identical with brain states.

The argument above is valid. Hence if the conclusion is to be resisted, either or both premises must be rejected. Which premises, if any, do you think should go, and why?

Book answer:

> Essentially, it is possible that premise 2 may not hold.

## Exercise 3.4

Can you see a possible response to the challenge outlined above? Think about this and discuss it with someone else.

Book answer:

> All we need to do is to construct the disjunctive property *either* P *or* P1 *or* P2 *or* P3 ... *or* Pn.

## Exercise 3.5

Can you see a problem with the reductionist's response? Hint: think about what hte features of properties are, and determine whether so-called disjunctive properties can qualify.

Book answer:

> The problem with the reductionist's response is as follows. Even if P, P1, P2, and P3, etc. are properties when each is considered singly by itself, it does not follow that their disjunctive combination represents a genuine property.

## Exercise 3.6

What answer would be returned by common sense to the above question in your opinion, and why would it be fatal to reductive materialism? What contrasting answer has to be given by the reductive materialist and why? Think about this on your own and if possible discuss it with someone else. Then compare my commentary below.

Book answer:

> The common-sense answer to the question posed in the last paragraph is that each token of a different type of neurophysiological state possesses the same type of mental property, namely the property of thinking about what there is for dinner, and that is why the different physical token are instantiations of hte same type of mental state. It seems to me that this is the correct answer to the question and helps to constitute yet another reason for not subscribing to the strict physicalism. Clearly, however, it is not going to satisfy the reductive materialist...

## Kripke's Argument Against Identity Theory

> "But this is where Kripke wishes to make his essential point, namely that the case of water and the case of pain are radically different. All that is necessary for pain to be pain is that it feels like pain. There is not, and cannot be any distinction between pain and pain feel-alike in the way that there is a distinction between water and water look-alike. You could have something that looked exactly like water, but nevertheless isn't water, because what it looks like is not essential to its being what it is, whereas its inner constitution, by contrast, is essential. But you could *not* have something that felt exactly like pain but which wasn't pain, because what is essential to pain being pain is simply the way it feels.
