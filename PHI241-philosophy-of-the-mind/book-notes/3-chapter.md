# Chapter 3: The Mind/Brain Identity Theory

## Exercise 3.1

Try applying the symmetry of identity to the mind/brain identity theory. What result do you get? What do you think its significance is?

My answer:

> When I apply the phrasing that mental states are brain states, there is no confusing or contradicting part of that phrase. However, when I apply the phrasing that brain states are mental states, we run into an issue. How do mental states *cause* brain states to show? Is there a clear way or route for this to occur? Where do the mental states affect in the brain in order to cause brain states? We run into the same problem that we did for Dualism.

Book answer:

> The upshot is that you cannot say that mental states are really only processes (really, truly) but that brain processes are not really mental states. To make this claim privileges the physical over the mental without justification. What it does, in effect, is to get rid of mental features in favor of brain features. It claims, effectively, that at the end of the day, there are only brain features.
