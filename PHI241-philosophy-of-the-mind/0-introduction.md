Substance vs. Property / Qualities

"The ball is red and round." The ball is the *substance*, and *red and round* are the properties that the ball has.

**When we think about the mind, should be think of it as a substance, or a collection of properties that something can have?**

If you think of the soul, generally people think of it to be a substance.
One might instead believe that the mind is a collection of properties.

If there a way to explain the *experience* of seeing the color red, only through physical explanations?

### [Dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism)

- There are physical things, and there are non-physical, more spiritual things
- *Descartes* related the mind to a non-physical thing

How can interaction between physical and non-physical things takes place? This is a big question left by dualism.

### [Monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_monism)

- The only reality that exist are the physical things, and everything is explained through those physical things
- Thus the mind must be physical, resulting from the state of the brain (and its surroundings).

Do computers have minds? Do they have the capability of thinking? What is the difference between computer "thinking" and human "thinking"?

In relation ot the *turing test*, does it make sense to ascribe the mind to something that is practically indifferent to a person?

### [Eliminative Materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism)

Eliminative materialism (also called eliminativism) is a materialist position in the philosophy of mind. It is the idea that the majority of mental states in folk psychology do not exist.

### [Behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism)

Behaviorism is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that behavior is either a reflex evoked by the pairing of certain antecedent stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment contingencies, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli.

The mind is explained by the behavior that one displays. This allows *other people* to "get a peak" inside someone else's mind, through the observation of what they are doing.

The output are the most important part of behaviorism, not as much of the inputs and internal state. Behaviorism is a more narrow view of functionalism, which is a broader scope.

### [Functionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind))

In the philosophy of mind, functionalism is the thesis that each and every mental state (for example, the state of having a belief, of having a desire, or of being in pain) is constituted solely by its functional role, which means its causal relation to other mental states, sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.

We can understand mental event in terms of a systems of inputs, internal state, and the resulting output that comes from those inputs and internal states.

We can ignore the hardware, meaning what is facilitating that transition of state based on inputs, and focus on the function itself and how it works. The material the function is comprised of is not a factor of how the function works. This somewhat implies that, given enough scale and time, consciousness can be developed from essentially any material.
