# Dualism

**Dualism**: two kinds of things: mental (minds) and physical (bodies)

**Substance dualism**: the mind is a distinct, non-physical thing, whose identity is independent of any physical body to which it may be temporarily attached

- Mental states and activities are the states and activities of this unique non-physical substance
- By "non-physical" the dualist means that the mind cannot be understood or explained by the physical sciences, i.e. physics, neuroscience, or computer science. The mind is irreducible to the sciences of matter.

| Substance | Properties / Qualities |
| --: | :-- |
| The ball | is red |

## Plato

Identifies the **I** with the mind/soul, an immaterial substance.
Death is the separation of the soul from the body
Reincarnation is believed.

### Theory of forms

- We don't acquire knowledge through the body, but through the mind alone.
- Ideas exist, but only in a non-physical way.

All earthly things are in constant flux, constant change. Plato believed that we can have knowledge of unchanging things, so he concluded that those unchanging things must exist in another plane of existence.

| Form | Implementation |
| :-: | :-: |
| Equality itself | equal sticks or equal stones |

- Body is an obstacle in acquiring knowledge. The body can only see and interact with *implementations* of **Forms**. Implementations are just bad imitations of Forms.

- Body contaminates the soul; philosopher seeks to release the soul from the body. Philosopher practices for dying.

- Mental-Physical causation and relation.

## Descartes

- Argument from Inference to the Best Explanation: *Discourse of method*, *Letter to More*, *Letter to Marquess of Newcastle*
- Argument from Doubt, *Meditation 1*
- Argument from Indivisibility, *Meditation 6*
- Argument from Introspection or Intuition, *Meditation 6*
- Argument from Conceivability, *Meditation 6*

### 1. Argument for Inference to the Best Explanation

- Machines and animals could never use language in all the appropriate ways that we use it
- Animals act like clocks with wheels and springs
- Animals act without thought or reason
- Language is the sole sign and certain mark of the presence of thought
- Mind needed to explain how use of language is possible
- Posits theoretical entity to explain phenomena

Descartes sees animals as natural machines.
Descartes believes the mind/body connection takes place in the *Pineal* gland in the brain. This is difficult to justify when the mind is a non-physical thing.

### What Phenomena resist scientific explanation?

1. **Consciousness**. How can grey matter be conscious?
1. **Intentionality**.
1. **Subjectivity**. I can feel my pain and you cannot. Each person has her own point of view and is aware of her own mental states. How can we accommodate the reality of subjective mental phenomena with the scientific...
1. **Mental Causation**. Our thoughts affect the way we behave and have real causal effect on the world. How can anything mental casually affect anything physical?

### 2. Argument from Doubt

- Descartes can deny that he has a body but he cannot deny that he exists as a mind.
- Leibniz law: If *a* is identical to *b*, then everything predicable of *a* is predicable of *b*.
- Argument:
    1. I am certain that I exist.
    1. I am *not* certain that my body exists
    1. If (i) and (ii), then I am different from my body.
    1. I am different from my body.

'I think, therefore I am" (Cogito, ergo sum)

#### Issue of 1

If I can doubt the existence of my body but cannot doubt my own existence, does this mean that I am different from my body?

> No, because doubt is an opinion of something external, not something that is intrinsic to the subject I am talking about.

### 3. Argument from Individuality

1. My body is divisible.
1. My mind is not divisible.
1. If (1) and (2), then my mind is different from my body
1. **My mind is different from my body**

Support: Mind remains intact even if body parts are removed. Each faculty of the mind is a faculty of the whole mind, not a part.

#### Issues of 3

- Does premise 2 bed the question against hte materialist?
- Can minds be divided?
- Mind may be an activity and activities cannot be divided in the way material substances can. Why can't the mind be a physical activity.

### 4. Argument from Introspection

- Descartes claims to have introspective knowledge of himself as only a thinking thing and that nothing bodily pertains to his nature.
- Descartes claims to have a clear and distinct perception of himself as a conscious being, not an extended being.

#### Issues of 4

- Does introspection provide an exhaustive understanding of one's nature?

> No, because if you have ever surprised yourself, then you did not understand everything about yourself introspectively.

- Does introspection differ from other perceptual faculties?
- Can Descartes be sure that he is thinking think as opposed to begin sure that thinking is going on that something thinks?

> For the sentence 'the ball is round' to be true, there has to be two things that are true; there both has to be a ball, and it has to be round. The same is true for the phrase 'I think'. The 'think' seems pretty obvious and undeniable, but the same is not strictly true for the 'I'.

- Spinoza: one and the same being may be conscious and extended

### 5. Argument from Conceivability

- Descartes can conceive of himself existing separate from his body or any body at all. Compare Swinburne.
- Argument (Feldman):
    1. I am such that is it possible to conceive of me existing apart from by body.
    1. By body is not such that it is possible to conceive of it existing apart from by body.
    1. If (i) and (ii), then I am distinct from my body.
    1. I am distinct from my body.

#### Support

- Swinburne: We can conceive of ourselves existing without a body, i.e. afterlife, angels, or acquiring a new body. No contradiction
- Right property to distinguish mind from body under Leibniz's Law
- Swinburne: personal identity is unanalyzable
- Swinburne: posit immaterial (soul) stuff to insure identity of oneself as a substance (Aristotelian modification). Also, posit that this stuff cannot divide. We cannot be in two place or have two perspectives at once.

> The sentence 'I don't know who I am' is a really tricky thing to talk about.
