# Dualism

**Dualism**: two kinds of things: mental (minds) and physical (bodies)

**Substance dualism**: the mind is a distinct, non-physical thing, whose identity is independent of any physical body to which it may be temporarily attached

- Mental states and activities are the states and activities of this unique non-physical substance
- By "non-physical" the dualist means that the mind cannot be understood or explained by the physical sciences, i.e. physics, neuroscience, or computer science. The mind is irreducible to the sciences of matter.

| Substance | Properties / Qualities |
| --: | :-- |
| The ball | is red |

## Plato

Identifies the **I** with the mind/soul, an immaterial substance.
Death is the separation of the soul from the body
Reincarnation is believed.

### Theory of forms

- We don't acquire knowledge through the body, but through the mind alone.
- Ideas exist, but only in a non-physical way.

All earthly things are in constant flux, constant change. Plato believed that we can have knowledge of unchanging things, so he concluded that those unchanging things must exist in another plane of existence.

| Form | Implementation |
| :-: | :-: |
| Equality itself | equal sticks or equal stones |

- Body is an obstacle in acquiring knowledge. The body can only see and interact with *implementations* of **Forms**. Implementations are just bad imitations of Forms.

- Body contaminates the soul; philosopher seeks to release the soul from the body. Philosopher practices for dying.

- Mental-Physical causation and relation.

## Descartes

- Argument from Inference to the Best Explanation: *Discourse of method*, *Letter to More*, *Letter to Marquess of Newcastle*
- Argument from Doubt, *Meditation 1*
- Argument from Indivisibility, *Meditation 6*
- Argument from Introspection or Intuition, *Meditation 6*
- Argument from Conceivability, *Meditation 6*

### 1. Argument for Inference to the Best Explanation

- Machines and animals could never use language in all the appropriate ways that we use it
- Animals act like clocks with wheels and springs
- Animals act without thought or reason
- Language is the sole sign and certain mark of the presence of thought
- Mind needed to explain how use of language is possible
- Posits theoretical entity to explain phenomena

Descartes sees animals as natural machines.
Descartes believes the mind/body connection takes place in the *Pineal* gland in the brain. This is difficult to justify when the mind is a non-physical thing.

### What Phenomena resist scientific explanation?

1. **Consciousness**. How can grey matter be conscious?
1. **Intentionality**.
1. **Subjectivity**. I can feel my pain and you cannot. Each person has her own point of view and is aware of her own mental states. How can we accommodate the reality of subjective mental phenomena with the scientific...
1. **Mental Causation**. Our thoughts affect the way we behave and have real causal effect on the world. How can anything mental casually affect anything physical?

### 2. Argument from Doubt

- Descartes can deny that he has a body but he cannot deny that he exists as a mind.
- Leibniz law: If *a* is identical to *b*, then everything predicable of *a* is predicable of *b*.
- Argument:
    1. I am certain that I exist.
    1. I am *not* certain that my body exists
    1. If (i) and (ii), then I am different from my body.
    1. I am different from my body.

'I think, therefore I am" (Cogito, ergo sum)

#### Issue

If I can doubt the existence of my body but cannot doubt my own existence, does this mean that I am different from my body?

> No, because doubt is an opinion of something external, not something that is intrinsic to the subject I am talking about.
