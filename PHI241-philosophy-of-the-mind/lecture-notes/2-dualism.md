# Dualism

**Dualism**: two kinds of things: mental (minds) and physical (bodies)

**Substance dualism**: the mind is a distinct, non-physical thing, whose identity is independent of any physical body to which it may be temporarily attached

- Mental states and activities are the states and activities of this unique non-physical substance
- By "non-physical" the dualist means that the mind cannot be understood or explained by the physical sciences, i.e. physics, neuroscience, or computer science. The mind is irreducible to the sciences of matter.

| Substance | Properties / Qualities |
| --: | :-- |
| The ball | is red |

## Plato

Identifies the "I" with the mind/soul
    - an immaterial substance

Death = the separation of the soul from the body

Reincarnation

**Theory of forms**
    - We don't acquire knowledge through the body, but through the mind alone.
    - Ideas exist, but only in a non-physical way.

| Form | Implementation |
| :-: | :-: |
| Equality itself | equal sticks or equal stones |

Body is an obstacle in acquiring knowledge. The body can only see and interact with *implementations* of **Forms**. Implementations are just bad imitations of Forms.

Body contaminates the soul; philosopher seeks to release the soul from the body. Philosopher practices for dying.

Mental-Physical causation and relation.
