# The Mind / Brain Identity Theory

## Julien Offray de La Mettrie

La Mettrie argued that man is an evolutionary product of nature just like other animals -- there is no sharp cut-off point between us and nonhuman animals, contrary to what Descartes averred. Human beings are essentially machines controlled by the neurology of the brain.

## Mind / Brain Identity Theory

**Monism**: only physical phenomena (material states and their properties) are real. Human beings are material entities whose workings and properties can be completely understood in terms of the concepts and theories of a complete physics.

**David Chalmers**: can we really account for experience, but maybe we need to explore the physical phenomena more, explore science more, to uncover the secrets that we currently don't understand.

## Mind / Brain Identity

It is **not** an analytical truth that the mind is identical to the brain.

An analytical truth is something that is true in virtue of the meaning of the words, for example

- All trilaterals are identical with three-sided figures
- Bachelors are unmarried males.
- Triangles have three sides.

It is not analytically true that pains are C-fibers firing the brain.

"Pain" means something different from "C-fibers firing", just as "the reporter who works wit hLois Lane at the Daily Planet" means something different from "the man of steel".

However, this difference in the meaning of the terms does not mean that pains cannot be identical with c-fibers firing in the brain.

## Type-Type Identity

Type-type identities discovered in science:

- Water = H20
- Lightening = a pattern of electrical discharges
- Genes = encoded sequences on DNA molecules

Are mental states type-type identical to brain states?

- Pain = C-fibers firing?
- Does "pain" and "c-fiber firing" refer to the same thing?

Is a specific type of mental state, i.e. pain, identical to a specific type of physical (brain) state?

## Ontological Reductionism

Ontological Reductionism: If a mental state M is identical with a brain state B, M can obtain only if B obtains, and B can obtain only if M obtains.

There should be *psychological laws* linking mental states between brain states. There should be an exceptionless set of correlations between a given type of mental states and a given type of brain state.

See Maslin p. 70 for how this works with the identity of the temperature of a gas with the average kinetic energy of its molecules.

Some evidence from PET and MRI linking specific areas of the brain with certain types of mental states, i.e. language areas of the brain.

## Problem for Type-Type Identity Theory

Why can't types of mental states be realized in a multitude of different types of brain states, just as a computer program can be realized in a variety of mediums?

Support from plasticity of brain following strokes.

Analogy with how watches can be realized in a variety of physical arrangements of parts.
