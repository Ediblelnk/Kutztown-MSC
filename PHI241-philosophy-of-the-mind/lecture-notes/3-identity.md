# The Mind / Brain Identity Theory

## Julien Offray de La Mettrie

La Mettrie argued that man is an evolutionary product of nature just like other animals -- there is no sharp cut-off point between us and nonhuman animals, contrary to what Descartes averred. Human beings are essentially machines controlled by the neurology of the brain.

## Mind / Brain Identity Theory

**Monism**: only physical phenomena (material states and their properties) are real. Human beings are material entities whose workings and properties can be completely understood in terms of the concepts and theories of a complete physics.

**David Chalmers**: can we really account for experience, but maybe we need to explore the physical phenomena more, explore science more, to uncover the secrets that we currently don't understand.

### Mind / Brain Identity

It is **not** an analytical truth that the mind is identical to the brain.

An analytical truth is something that is true in virtue of the meaning of the words, for example

- All trilaterals are identical with three-sided figures
- Bachelors are unmarried males.
- Triangles have three sides.

It is not analytically true that pains are C-fibers firing the brain.

"Pain" means something different from "C-fibers firing", just as "the reporter who works wit hLois Lane at the Daily Planet" means something different from "the man of steel".

However, this difference in the meaning of the terms does not mean that pains cannot be identical with c-fibers firing in the brain.

## Type-Type Identity

Type-type identities discovered in science:

- Water = H20
- Lightening = a pattern of electrical discharges
- Genes = encoded sequences on DNA molecules

Are mental states type-type identical to brain states?

- Pain = C-fibers firing?
- Does "pain" and "c-fiber firing" refer to the same thing?

Is a specific type of mental state, i.e. pain, identical to a specific type of physical (brain) state?

### Ontological Reductionism

Ontological Reductionism: If a mental state M is identical with a brain state B, M can obtain only if B obtains, and B can obtain only if M obtains.

There should be *psychological laws* linking mental states between brain states. There should be an exceptionless set of correlations between a given type of mental states and a given type of brain state.

See Maslin p. 70 for how this works with the identity of the temperature of a gas with the average kinetic energy of its molecules.

Some evidence from PET and MRI linking specific areas of the brain with certain types of mental states, i.e. language areas of the brain.

### Problem for Type-Type Identity Theory

Why can't types of mental states be realized in a multitude of different types of brain states, just as a computer program can be realized in a variety of mediums?

Support from plasticity of brain following strokes.

Analogy with how watches can be realized in a variety of physical arrangements of parts.

See figure 3.4 in Maslin p. 72

## Token-Token Identity Theory

Each token of a mental state is identical to some physical state. Particular mental states are identical to particular brain states.

Strengths of Identity Theory:

1. Simpler theory than dualism - fewer kinds of entities and propertied posited
1. Eliminates problem of mind-body interaction
1. Explains injuries to the brain lead to changes in mental functioning

### Problems for the Identity Theory

1. **Brain states have spatial dimensions but mental states do not.**
    - Nagel's response: having a certain sensation or thought and being in a certain physical state both have spatial location - both exist where the person is.

1. **The symmetry of identity statements: no more reason to say that mental states are just brain states than to say that brain states are just mental states.**
    - Is there any reason to privilege the physical over the mental?
    - It seems that we have to admit that some brain states have mental properties. We can't avoid property dualism, *because we claim that both are real*.

1. Intentional mental states: Can intentionality be naturalized?
    1. Intentional mental states represent, or are about, states of affairs external to them, including states of affairs that do not -- and perhaps never did -- exist. For example, beliefs, desires, dreams, intentions, emotions, hopes, thoughts, as well as many other mental states, possess a representational content.
    1. No brain state can possess representational content. (What about photographs containing intentional content?)
    1. Therefore, intentional mental states cannot be identical with brain states.

## Intentionality Naturalized

Jerry Fodor: "Mentalese" -- There is a language of thought in the brain consisting ont of words but of computational states realized in synaptic and neural processes.

How are these brain states "about" anything? How are they supposed to represent states of affairs external to them?

Two theories:

1. Resemblance theory
1. Causation theory

### Resemblance Theory

A representation, R, represents a state of affairs, S, if and only if R resembles S.

Ignore this theory, as resemblance is a different relation than representation:

> Felipe and Pedro are identical twins and thus resemble each other but do not represent each other.
> The name "Pedro" represents Pedro but does not resemble him.
> Resemblance is a symmetric thing.

### Causation Theory

When there is a causal co-variance or reliable indication, there is intentionality.

**Fred Dretske**: Tree rings represent past weather. The tree rings contain reliable information about weather in the past years. The rings vary in a dependable and law-like way with changes in the tree's environment, that is, they causally co-vary.

**Marvin Minsky**: Thermostats are about the ambient temperature. They vary in a law-like way with the temperature. They indicate the ambient temperature. They have three beliefs: it's too hot in here; it's too cold in here; it's just right in here.
