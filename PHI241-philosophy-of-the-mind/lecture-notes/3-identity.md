# The Mind / Brain Identity Theory

## Julien Offray de La Mettrie

La Mettrie argued that man is an evolutionary product of nature just like other animals -- there is no sharp cut-off point between us and nonhuman animals, contrary to what Descartes averred. Human beings are essentially machines controlled by the neurology of the brain.

## Mind / Brain Identity Theory

**Monism**: only physical phenomena (material states and their properties) are real. Human beings are material entities whose workings and properties can be completely understood in terms of the concepts and theories of a complete physics.

**David Chalmers**: can we really account for experience, but maybe we need to explore the physical phenomena more, explore science more, to uncover the secrets that we currently don't understand.

### Mind / Brain Identity

It is **not** an analytical truth that the mind is identical to the brain.

An analytical truth is something that is true in virtue of the meaning of the words, for example

- All trilaterals are identical with three-sided figures
- Bachelors are unmarried males.
- Triangles have three sides.

It is not analytically true that pains are C-fibers firing the brain.

"Pain" means something different from "C-fibers firing", just as "the reporter who works wit hLois Lane at the Daily Planet" means something different from "the man of steel".

However, this difference in the meaning of the terms does not mean that pains cannot be identical with c-fibers firing in the brain.

## Type-Type Identity

Type-type identities discovered in science:

- Water = H20
- Lightening = a pattern of electrical discharges
- Genes = encoded sequences on DNA molecules

Are mental states type-type identical to brain states?

- Pain = C-fibers firing?
- Does "pain" and "c-fiber firing" refer to the same thing?

Is a specific type of mental state, i.e. pain, identical to a specific type of physical (brain) state?

### Ontological Reductionism

Ontological Reductionism: If a mental state M is identical with a brain state B, M can obtain only if B obtains, and B can obtain only if M obtains.

There should be *psychological laws* linking mental states between brain states. There should be an exceptionless set of correlations between a given type of mental states and a given type of brain state.

See Maslin p. 70 for how this works with the identity of the temperature of a gas with the average kinetic energy of its molecules.

Some evidence from PET and MRI linking specific areas of the brain with certain types of mental states, i.e. language areas of the brain.

### Problem for Type-Type Identity Theory

Why can't types of mental states be realized in a multitude of different types of brain states, just as a computer program can be realized in a variety of mediums?

Support from plasticity of brain following strokes.

Analogy with how watches can be realized in a variety of physical arrangements of parts.

See figure 3.4 in Maslin p. 72

## Token-Token Identity Theory

Each token of a mental state is identical to some physical state. Particular mental states are identical to particular brain states.

Strengths of Identity Theory:

1. Simpler theory than dualism - fewer kinds of entities and propertied posited
1. Eliminates problem of mind-body interaction
1. Explains injuries to the brain lead to changes in mental functioning

### Problems for the Identity Theory

1. **Brain states have spatial dimensions but mental states do not.**
    - Nagel's response: *having* a certain sensation or thought and *being* in a certain physical state both have spatial location - both exist where the person is.

1. **The symmetry of identity statements: no more reason to say that mental states are just brain states than to say that brain states are just mental states.**
    - Is there any reason to privilege the physical over the mental?
    - It seems that we have to admit that some brain states have mental properties. We can't avoid property dualism, *because we claim that both are real*.

1. Qualia, privileged access, and the irreducibility of the mental: We need to identify the mental state independently of how we identify the physical state, if the claim about their identity is empirically based. However, when we are aware of our thoughts and sensations, we are aware of features of them other than public physical properties of brain processes. So, the features of our mental states (qualia) must be different from the features of our brain states. We cannot avoid a dualism of properties.
See Schaeffer's objection to Smart's identify theory.

1. **Intentional mental states: Can intentionality be naturalized?**
    1. Intentional mental states represent, or are about, states of affairs external to them, including states of affairs that do not -- and perhaps never did -- exist. For example, beliefs, desires, dreams, intentions, emotions, hopes, thoughts, as well as many other mental states, possess a representational content.
    1. No brain state can possess representational content. (What about photographs containing intentional content?)
    1. Therefore, intentional mental states cannot be identical with brain states.

## Intentionality Naturalized

Jerry Fodor: "Mentalese" -- There is a language of thought in the brain consisting ont of words but of computational states realized in synaptic and neural processes.

How are these brain states "about" anything? How are they supposed to represent states of affairs external to them?

Two theories:

1. Resemblance theory
1. Causation theory

## Resemblance Theory

A representation, R, represents a state of affairs, S, if and only if R resembles S.

Ignore this theory, as resemblance is a different relation than representation:

> Felipe and Pedro are identical twins and thus resemble each other but do not represent each other.
> The name "Pedro" represents Pedro but does not resemble him.
> Resemblance is a symmetric thing.

## Causation Theory

When there is a causal co-variance or reliable indication, there is intentionality. The idea is that you can have representation when you have something that behaves in a very "law-like" way in response to some external phenomena.

**Fred Dretske**: Tree rings represent past weather. The tree rings contain reliable information about weather in the past years. The rings vary in a dependable and law-like way with changes in the tree's environment, that is, they causally co-vary.

**Marvin Minsky**: Thermostats are about the ambient temperature. They vary in a law-like way with the temperature. They indicate the ambient temperature. They have three beliefs: it's too hot in here; it's too cold in here; it's just right in here.

### Problems for Causation Theory

1. How can it explain **how we can have thoughts about things that do not exist**, since non-existent things have no causal power?
1. **Reliable indication cannot be a sufficient condition** for B to represent A. Example: a scanner may have a systematic fault in leaving out the word "not" every time it scans the 10 commandments. Even though it consistently co-varies with the paper on which the ten commandments are written, we would not say that it represents the ten commandments. Something more is needed for representation.
1. Quine's "Gavagai" objection -- **How can the causal theorist explain why we have one concept as opposed to another concept**, i.e. rabbit versus undetached rabbit part ,when the causal stimulus condition for both concepts are the same? How can the causal theorist explain the difference between the two beliefs?
1. Donald Davidson -- holism of the mental and "constitutive ideal of rationality"
    To ascribe mental states to someone, such as a belief or desire, we need to understand them in some coherent, consistent, and rational relation to other mental states. This ideal of rationality is essential to understanding mental states and intentionality. However, this principle governing the mental is radically different from the principles that govern our understanding of physical phenomenon. So Davidson thinks that there are no laws linking the mental and the physical.

## Kripke and Identity Theory

Reminders:

**Type-type** Identity Theory:

- each type of mental state is identical to a type of brain state.

**Token-token** identity Theory:

- each *particular* mental state is identical to a *particular* physical state.
- Token Identity Theory allows for the multi-realizability of mental states

### Is the identity supposed to be analytically true or contingently true?

**Analytically true**: true by virtue of the meaning of the term.

- Denial of analytic truth is self-contradictory
- Also called **a priori**, or **De dicto** truths

**Contingently true**: true, but not by the exact meaning of the terms. The truth must be uncovered or proven.

- Denial of the truth is wrong, but not **self**-contradictory
- Also called **a posteriori**, **De re** truths

### Kripke's Argument Against the Mind-Brain Identity Theory

"Pain is c-fiber firing" is contingently true. The world could have been different. Pain might have been identical to anything physical. But, it turns out that in this world pain is identical to c-fibers firing.

If "pain is c-fiber firing" is true, then it must be *de re* necessarily true. However, it cannot be *de re* necessarily true, because we can conceive of the possibility that pain might not be a physical state at all. if we can conceive of the possibility that pain is not a physical state at all ,the pain cannot be a physical state.

## Eliminative Materialist

The language of the mental is broken and fundamentally flawed, and eventually we will use the languages of science in order to explain it *properly*.
