# Second Class Notes

## The Mind-Body Problem

1. What is the nature of the mind, mental states, and mental events? Physical, non-physical, both?
1. What is the nature of the individual/subjects that have minds and experiences? Are these individuals physical or non-physical? Do the individuals exist independent of their minds or are they constituted by their minds? Can experiences exist independently from the individuals that have them?
1. How do mental states and subjects relate to the physical world? Can mental states exist independently of physical phenomena or do they depend on them for their existence? If there is a dependency relations, how can this occur, since mental states seem so different from physical states?

> Descartes believes that mental states **can** exist without someone explicitly there to *have* those mental states. They are non-physical.

## What kind of mental states are there?

1. **Sensations**: pains, aches, tickles,itches, throbs, tingles.
    - Parasitic
1. **Cognitions**: believing, knowing, understanding, conceiving, thinking, reasoning.
    - Internal
1. **Emotions**: fear, jealousy, envy, anger, grief, indignation, enjoyment.
    - Internal
1. **Perceptions**: seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching.
    - Internal
1. **Quasi-perceptual states**: dreaming, imagining, seeing in the mind's eye, hallucinating, seeing after-images
    - Internal
1. **Conative states**: acting, trying, wanting, intending, wishing.
    - Internal

## Why cal them mental "states" as opposed to mental things or objects?

"Thing" and "object" suggest substances entities, rather than properties or activities that some substantive entity may have or be engaged in.

Presumably, mental states could not exist independently of some substantive entity. There are no free floating sensations, thoughts, perceptions, imaginings, etc. that cn exist independently of someone or something having those thoughts, perceptions, imagining, etc. For example, there cannot be pain in a room unless someone is in pain.

However, what kind of substantive entity has the mental property or is in the mental state is up for grabs.

> Substances vs. Properties

## Names and pronouns are often used to refer to the substantive entity has mental states?

We often use personal pronouns and proper names to refer to the substantive entity that has mental states, i.e. "I" am in pain or am thinking of the Pythagorean Theorem; "You" are in pain or thinking of the Pythagorean Theorem; Jane is in pain or thinking of the Pythagorean Theorem; My dog, Helmi, is in pain but is not thinking of the Pythagorean Theorem.

Consider also "IBM Watson" is not in pain but is thinking of the Pythagorean Theorem. My Ring Camera is seeing a deer in my driveway. HAL was upset by being given conflicting directives in 2001 A Space Odyssey.

## What kind of entity has mental states? What does "I" refer to?

**Rene Descartes**: an immaterial mind/soul
**Thomas Aquinas**: an ensouled body
**Eric Olson**: a human organism (bodily criterion of personal identity)
**John Locke**: just the bundle of continuous mental states regardless of what the underlying substance may be (memory criterion of personal identity)
    - Identity is completed tied to the memory of the individual.
    - It does create questions of the lack of memory relations and whether or not that is a person.
    - Somewhat related to functionalism

> I am partial to John Locke's view of the "I".

**Peter Strawson**: Persons - substances with physical and mental states
    - Some people think this definition is a little broad, because it might include animals we typically don't call people.

> Hylomorphism is a philosophical doctrine developed by the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, which conceives every physical entity or being as a compound of matter and immaterial form, with the generic form as immanently real within the individual.

## What are some marks of the mental states that may distinguish mental states from physical states?

1. Qualia or "raw feels" - consciousness of what an experience is like, i.e. what the trumpet sounds like, what hte sky looks like to me, how my toothache feels, how the pain in my shoulder feels.
What kind of mental states have qualia essentially such that they exist only when you are aware of them and therefore would not exist if you were not aware of them?

> Sensations

## Sensations have qualia essentially

> Qualia: the internal and subjective component of sense perceptions, arising from stimulation of the senses by phenomena.

If you do not feel any pain ,the pain doesn't exist.
If you have pain, you must feel it.
Whereas physical things can exist without anyone being aware of them, sensations cannot exist without someone being aware of them.

What about perceptions?

## Do mental states other than sensations have qualia?

- Other kinds of mental states, such as cognitions and conative states do not necessarily have qualia and they may exist even if you are not aware of them.
- What are some examples?
- What about emotions, perceptions, and quasi-perceptual states? Do they have qualia? Do they exist only if one is aware of them?

> Assumptions are a kind of mental state, disposition, which we may not be aware of.
> Instinct influence us, but we are not aware of it.
