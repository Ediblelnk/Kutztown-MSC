# Functionalism

## What is a function?

Example: Thermostat
Other Examples?
    Distinguish:
        The function of X (what job X performs)
        What arrangements enable something to perform its function

### Examples of functions

Artifacts like mousetraps, can openers, computers, pin setter at bowling alley, coke machine...
Mathematical functions like x^4 = y
Jobs like mayor, doctor, and plumber

## Mind is a function

Distinguish:
    The function of X, i.e. 'what job X performs'
    What arrangements enable something to perform its function

## Functions

Functions can be described abstractly and completely independent of whatever it is that enables the function to be discharged.

> Input > Internal states > output.

Functions are multiply realizable. Assume that functions must be embodied.

## Mental States as Functional States

"Metaphysical Functionalism" -- Abstract description of a function.

Example: pain (p. 124)
    Input (tissue damage) > Pain > Output (groaning & desire to be rid of pain)

Note that "desire" is another functional state

## Psychofunctionalism

The set of arrangements enable the mental function (abstractly or formally specified) to be executed.

In principle, the functions could be executed in non-physical processes (soul stuff). Most functionalists are materialists. Mental functions are embodied in neurophysiological processes of the pain and nervous system. However, some functionalists maintain that mental functions can be embodied in computer chips.

### Psychofunctionalism versus Identity Theory

Identity theory tries to identify specific types of mental states with specific types of brain states. But, the multi-realizability of mental states makes this implausible.

Psychofunctionalism does not have this problem, since it does not try to reduce or identify types of mental states with types of brain states. A mental state such as pain could be realized in a variety of physical arrangements and, in principle, non-physical arrangements.

## Computational or Turing Machine Functionalism

See pages 129-134, see Ned Block's example of Coke Machine

Kathleen Wilkes' washing machine (hierarchically structured with subsystems)

## Machine Functionalism

Each mental system is described by at least one Turing Machine Table (TM) of a certain sort, and each type of mental state is identical to one of the machine table states.

Example: Machine table for a Coke machine. The TM itself is an abstract automation. The table is a description of the TM.

### Machine Table for Coke Machine

| | S1 = Dime desire | S2 = Nickel desire |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Nickel input** | Emit no output, Go to S2 | Emit a Coke, Go to S1 |
| **Dime input** | Emit a Coke, Stay in S1 | Emit a Coke and Nickel, Go to S1 |

If we considered the Coke machine a mental system, it would consists of two mental states:
    S1 = dime desire,
    S2 = nickel desire.

The table shows the specific relationship between the inputs, outputs, and states of the system. It indicates two functions:

1. The transitions from **inputs and states to *outputs***. For example, if the machine is in S1, and we put a dime into the machine, the machine puts out a Coke and remains the state S1.

1. The transition from **inputs and states to *states***. For example, if the machine is in S1 and we put in a nickel, the machine emits *no output* but goes into S2. Note S1 is part of the causal story of the machine going into S2. Mental states are individuated partly in terms of causal relations to other mental states.

There are four conditions to which the Coke machine table is equivalent to or representative of.

Any system that has a set of inputs, outputs, and states related in the way specified by the machine table is "**described**" by the machine table and is a "**realization**" of the abstract automation specified by the machine table.

The abstract automation or Turing machine can be realized by other machines, i.e. a 7-Up machine constructed of different material than that of the Coke machine, as long as the inputs, outputs, and states are related in the way specified by the machine table.

We can use the machine table to describe any system that has inputs, outputs, and internal states in the way specified by the machine table.

**Functionalists claim that** *in the same way that we can describe what it is for a simple system to be in state S1 or S2 in terms of the machine table, we can describe for any complex system that has inputs, outputs, and internal states what it is for that system to be in a particular state by a complex machine table.*

## Putnam's Qualifications

1. When applied to an organism, we must introduce the notion of a probabilistic automation: a Turing machine with probabilistic transitions between states rather than deterministic ones.

1. We must allow for the probabilistic automation to have sensory inputs, and motor-behavioral outputs. (Needed for TM as a model for mental operations of an organism.)

## Functionalism as a Theory of Mind

Human mind is an enormously complex machine table incarnated in the neurophysiological processes of the brain.

Human beings receive inputs in the form of sensory and perceptual information. This information is then processed in the brain. Then there is output in the form of behavior.

What makes any mental state the mental state that it is (what makes a pain a pain) is its having a certain causal role in relation to inputs, outputs, and other mental states.

### What Goes On In Our Brains?

Kathleen Wilkes' washing machine (hierarchically structured with subsystems)

Simplest functions are realized in molecules and atoms that make up nerve cells. Higher functions realized in brain structures like hippocampus, which is linked to long-term memories or Broca's area, which is linked to language processing.

Functionalism is an information processing model of the mind.

### Strength's of Functionalism

1. **Avoids behaviorism's error** of identifying mental states with behavior or potential outward behavior and also identity theory's error of claim that mental states can only exist as states of human brains.

1. **May fit with common sense idea that states like pain result from input** (tissue damage) and causes pain behavior and desire to be rid of pain.

1. Avoids problem of mind/body causal interaction, since mental states are defined in terms of the entire function of inputs, internal transition states, and outputs.

### Problems for Functionalism

**Liberalism**: Functionalism attributes mental states to things that (many say) don't have them.

Functionalism cannot account for:

1. **Qualia** - the subjectivity and privacy of mental states like sensations.
1. **Intentionality** - that mental states like beliefs, desires, and emotions are *about* certain things

#### The Chinese Mind Argument: Absent Qualia

    The Chinese Mind

#### The Problem of Inverted Qualia

Couldn't two people be in functionally equivalent states in terms of inputs and outputs but differ in their mental states?

> Two people may both say that the tree is green, even though what looks green to one person may look red to another.
> Couldn't two people be in the same functional state, but one feels pain and the other does not?
