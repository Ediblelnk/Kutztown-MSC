# Behaviorism

## Analytical (Logical) Behaviorism

**Analytical Behaviorism** claims that statements about the mind and mental states are *equivalent* to statements that describe a person's actual or potential public behavior.

Purported Advantages:

1. Avoid the problem of mind-body interaction. Mind doesn't *cause* behavior. It *is* behavior.
1. No mysterious emergent properties.
1. Dissolves problem of other minds.

## Methodological Behaviorism

**Methodological Behaviorism** is not a theory about the nature of the mind but a method in psychology for investigating psychological phenomena. Psychology is the study of human behavior.

Assumptions:

1. Science studies what is publicly observable.
1. Observations and experiments must be duplicate-able by others.

J. B. Watson and B. F. Skinner understand human behavior as a set of responses evoked by external stimuli. Set aside internal processes (brain events or intentional states) and focus on external stimuli and the behavior that it causes. Human behavior is a *conditioned* response.

## Analytical Behaviorism

Statements describing mental states can be translated without loss of meaning into statements describing possible and actual behavior.

Note: If analytical behaviorism is successful, the translations *cannot* contain any mental terms. This is to avoid circular definitions.

Analytical behaviorism is thus a form of **reductionism**.

## Carl Hempel (1905-1997) and 'Hard Behaviorism'

**Verificationist Theory of Meaning**: Unless a statement could, in principle be verified empirically, it would have to be rejected as devoid of meaning and empty of any significance.

Note: We might not now be able to verify how many moons may surround some distant planet, but a claim about the number of moon is in principle verifiable.

### Implication of Verificationist Theory of Meaning and Motivation for Behaviorism

If mental states are in principle private and accessible only to the person who has the mental states, then they cannot in principle be empirically verified by others. Therefore, all statements about them would be meaningless.

However, if statements about our and other's mental states are meaningful, then mental states must be verifiable by outward public behavior.

So, we need to translate statements about pains and other mental states into statements about behavior, as behavior is publicly observable.

## Challenge for Analytical Behaviorism

How can we translate statements about mental states into statements about behavior without invoking mental vocabulary?

Example: I have a toothache = my crying and making gestures about my mouth; I respond positively when someone asks me whether I have a toothache; ...

Which patterns of behavior as bodily movements are to count as an analysis of the mental terms? What problems might there be?

## A Second Problem: Multiple Realizability

The behavior associated with having a toothache could vary. How would this pose a problem for the translation?

Translations could never be completed. Translations would even be more complicated for an abstract belief, i.e., "I believe that as consciousness is, and why it exists." Many ways of expressing this belief.

How are we to identify which types of bodily movements are included in the behavioral translation and which are not? (i.e. subtle vs. gross movements)

## A Third Problem: Circularity and Infinite Regression

How can we translate into exclusively behavioral terms a statement like: "Manjit *wants* a packet of cigarettes?"

Would "Manjit will go and buy cigarettes" be an adequate translation?

What if Manjit also wants to stop smoking and this desire is stronger than his desire to buy cigarettes? Or what if Manjit believes that he does not have enough money for the cigarettes?

**Circularity/Regress**: A behavioral analysis of desire must involve reference to other desires and beliefs as un-analyzed mental terms. Also, a behavioral analysis of belief must involve reference to other beliefs and desires as un-analyzed mental terms.

## Gilbert Ryle *The Concept of Mind* (1949) and 'Soft Behaviorism'

Not trying to translate statements about mental states into statements about behavior. Instead, Ryle tries to dissolve the mind/body problem by showing that the Cartesian concept of the mind is a "Ghost in the Machine". Ryle thinks that dualists commit a "category mistake" by incorrectly applying concepts used to understand physical things to understand the mind.

### Cartesian Dualism

| Body | Mind |
| :-- | :-- |
| In space | Not in space |
| Subject to mechanical laws | Not subject to mechanical laws |
| Publicly accessible | Not publicly accessible |
| Events in "physical world" | Events in "mental world" |
| Corrigible judgments | Incorrigible judgments |
| Events are "external" | Events are "internal" |
| Material composition/function | Conscious composition/function |
| Situated in common field/space | Situated in insulated, private field/mind |
| Not transparent to observers -- we don't know everything | Transparent to observers -- we know all about them |
| Ordinary perception -- can err | Introspection -- immune from error |
| Corroborated by other's observing | No corroboration by others -- analogy |

## Category Mistake

Theory about how to analyze and understand the vocabulary that we use to talk about mental states, rather than a theory about what mental states are.

Category Mistake -- when we represent the facts of our mental life as if they belong to one logical type or category when they actually belong to another

### Category Mistakes

Ryle claims that we have been making a category mistake about the mind for a long time by applying idioms and descriptions of physical things to mental things, i.e. ascribe existence and causal properties to the mind.

Example: Construe mental conduct words, such as desires and intentions, as signifying non-mechanical processes. Represent minds as extra centers of causal processes.

Another Example:
"He built a house" vs. "He built a fantasy"
The latter describes a sequence of private events in a private space invoking mental arrangements. This talk leads to thinking that the mind is a spiritual thing with non-physical mental objects.

Other examples of category mistakes that the dualist makes:

1. Construe mental conduct words, such as desires and intentions, as signifying non-mechanical processes.
1. Represent minds as extra center of causal processes.
1. Represent minds as substantive entities.

## Soft Behaviorism

**All**  words and descriptions get their meaning from the circumstances in which we know it is correct to apply them. These "criterial conditions" for words to have meaning must be public, physical events. They cannot be private events, since there would then be no common understanding fo the terms. There are no criterial conditions for private meanings. If we invoke terms that we allege to have some private criterial content, we are speaking nonsense.

Ryle: Mind talk is really talk about our behavior and dispositions to behave and not talk about some inner ghostly entity.

We can fully describe what is happening when, for example, pains occur by using languages that refers only to the behavior or dispositions to behave of people suffering.

Mind/body problem is a confusion.

### Behaviorism and Other Minds

There is no "problem of other minds". There is no longer a problem of how we can know whether a non-physical, spiritual thing is present or absent in other bodies. All we need to know is whether other people behave or are disposed to behave in the ways in which the mental terms apply,

## Problems for Behaviorism

1. **Behaviorism treats mental events as the effects of whatever cause the behavior or dispositions to behave.** Mental events do not cause any behavior. But, we use mental concepts in our causal explanation of behavior. For example, "His pain caused him to cry out." "His jealousy caused him to commit the murder." Behavior is wrong because it omits the causal element in mental concepts.
    1. **Ryle and dualists want to distinguish intelligent beings from the rest of the world**. Ryle thinks that this can be done by distinguishing between the behavior of intelligent and non-intelligent beings.
    1. **Descartes thinks that this can be done by distinguishing between what *causes* the differences in their behavior**. Minds are introduced to explain *why* people differ from stones.
    1. Descartes thinks that we should accept dualism, because we need to posit minds to causally explain behavior, i.e. how language is possible.

1. **At least some mental descriptions, i.e. qualia of sensations, emotions, and feelings, refer to events or processes that are neither behavioral or dispositional**. Behaviorism leaves out the "sensation" of pain and our reactions to pain. There could be pains without pain behavior.
    1. Behaviorism cannot distinguish real pains from *imitations* of pain.
    1. Behaviorists claim that to have a pain is to acquire the disposition to have pain behavior. To decide to imitate pain is to acquire the disposition to have pain behavior and maybe the same set of pain expressing behaviors.
    1. So, having pains and deciding to imitate pain are not different sorts of mental episodes. But, clearly they are. Pains hurt and imitating pains does not hurt. There can be pain without pain behavior and pain behavior without pain.

## P.F. Strawson

Descartes: All statements about us are either statements about our minds or bodies.

Strawson: What does "I" refer to in the Cartesian view?

Answer: A non-physical immaterial mind/soul.
Problem: We must be able to distinguish "I" (my mind/soul) from that of another. Otherwise, we would have no reason for ruling out that there could be a hundred minds/souls that "I" might refer to. We need to be able to count souls.

But: How can we count souls if they are non-physical, spiritual entities? Strawson says that we can't. "I" must refer to the very same thing that I use physical descriptions of myself to refer to, i.e. a human being.

Later view: Person is a primitive term that we use to refer to beings to which we ascribe both physical and mental properties.
