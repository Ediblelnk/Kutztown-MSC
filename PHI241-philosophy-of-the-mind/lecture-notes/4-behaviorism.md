# Behaviorism

## Analytical (Logical) Behaviorism

**Analytical Behaviorism** claims that statements about the mind and mental states are *equivalent* to statements that describe a person's actual or potential public behavior.

Purported Advantages:

1. Avoid the problem of mind-body interaction. Mind doesn't *cause* behavior. It *is* behavior.
1. No mysterious emergent properties.
1. Dissolves problem of other minds.

## Methodological Behaviorism

**Methodological Behaviorism** is not a theory about the nature of the mind but a method in psychology for investigating psychological phenomena. Psychology is the study of human behavior.

Assumptions:

1. Science studies what is publicly observable.
1. Observations and experiments must be duplicate-able by others.

J. B. Watson and B. F. Skinner understand human behavior as a set of responses evoked by external stimuli. Set aside internal processes (brain events or intentional states) and focus on external stimuli and the behavior that it causes. Human behavior is a *conditioned* response.

## Analytical Behaviorism

Statements describing mental states can be translated without loss of meaning into statements describing possible and actual behavior.

Note: If analytical behaviorism is successful, the translations *cannot* contain any mental terms. This is to avoid circular definitions.

Analytical behaviorism is thus a form of **reductionism**.
