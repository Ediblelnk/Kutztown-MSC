# Behaviorism

## Analytical (Logical) Behaviorism

**Analytical Behaviorism** claims that statements about the mind and mental states are *equivalent* to statements that describe a person's actual or potential public behavior.

Purported Advantages:

1. Avoid the problem of mind-body interaction. Mind doesn't *cause* behavior. It *is* behavior.
1. No mysterious emergent properties.
1. Dissolves problem of other minds.

## Methodological Behaviorism

**Methodological Behaviorism** is not a theory about the nature of the mind but a method in psychology for investigating psychological phenomena. Psychology is the study of human behavior.

Assumptions:

1. Science studies what is publicly observable.
1. Observations and experiments must be duplicate-able by others.

J. B. Watson and B. F. Skinner understand human behavior as a set of responses evoked by external stimuli. Set aside internal processes (brain events or intentional states) and focus on external stimuli and the behavior that it causes. Human behavior is a *conditioned* response.

## Analytical Behaviorism

Statements describing mental states can be translated without loss of meaning into statements describing possible and actual behavior.

Note: If analytical behaviorism is successful, the translations *cannot* contain any mental terms. This is to avoid circular definitions.

Analytical behaviorism is thus a form of **reductionism**.

## Carl Hempel (1905-1997) and 'Hard Behaviorism'

**Verificationist Theory of Meaning**: Unless a statement could, in principle be verified empirically, it would have to be rejected as devoid of meaning and empty of any significance.

Note: We might not now be able to verify how many moons may surround some distant planet, but a claim about the number of moon is in principle verifiable.

### Implication of Verificationist Theory of Meaning and Motivation for Behaviorism

If mental states are in principle private and accessible only to the person who has the mental states, then they cannot in principle be empirically verified by others. Therefore, all statements about them would be meaningless.

However, if statements about our and other's mental states are meaningful, then mental states must be verifiable by outward public behavior.

So, we need to translate statements about pains and other mental states into statements about behavior, as behavior is publicly observable.

## Challenge for Analytical Behaviorism

How can we translate statements about mental states into statements about behavior without invoking mental vocabulary?

Example: I have a toothache = my crying and making gestures about my mouth; I respond positively when someone asks me whether I have a toothache; ...

Which patterns of behavior as bodily movements are to count as an analysis of the mental terms? What problems might there be?

## A Second Problem: Multiple Realizability

The behavior associated with having a toothache could vary. How would this pose a problem for the translation?

Translations could never be completed. Translations would even be more complicated for an abstract belief, i.e., "I believe that as consciousness is, and why it exists." Many ways of expressing this belief.

How are we to identify which types of bodily movements are included in the behavioral translation and which are not? (i.e. subtle vs. gross movements)

## A Third Problem: Circularity and Infinite Regression

How can we translate into exclusively behavioral terms a statement like: "Manjit *wants* a packet of cigarettes?"

Would "Manjit will go and buy cigarettes" be an adequate translation?

What if Manjit also wants to stop smoking and this desire is stronger than his desire to buy cigarettes? Or what if Manjit believes that he does not have enough money for the cigarettes?

**Circularity/Regress**: A behavioral analysis of desire must involve reference to other desires and beliefs as un-analyzed mental terms. Also, a behavioral analysis of belief must involve reference to other beliefs and desires as un-analyzed mental terms.

## Gilbert Ryle *The Concept of Mind* (1949) and 'Soft Behaviorism'

Not trying to translate statements about mental states into statements about behavior. Instead, Ryle tries to dissolve the mind/body problem by showing that the Cartesian concept of the mind is a "Ghost in the Machine". Ryle thinks that dualists commit a "category mistake" by incorrectly applying concepts used to understand physical things to understand the mind.

### Cartesian Dualism

| Body | Mind |
| :-- | :-- |
| In space | Not in space |
| Subject to mechanical laws | Not subject to mechanical laws |
| Publicly accessible | Not publicly accessible |
| Events in "physical world" | Events in "mental world" |
| Corrigible judgments | Incorrigible judgments |
| Events are "external" | Events are "internal" |
| Material composition/function | Conscious composition/function |
| Situated in common field/space | Situated in insulated, private field/mind |
| Not transparent to observers -- we don't know everything | Transparent to observers -- we know all about them |
| Ordinary perception -- can err | Introspection -- immune from error |
| Corroborated by other's observing | No corroboration by others -- analogy |

## Category Mistake

Theory about how to analyze and understand the vocabulary that we use to talk about mental states, rather than a theory about what mental states are.

Category Mistake -- when we represent the facts of our mental life as if they belong to one logical type or category when they actually belong to another

### Category Mistakes

Ryle claims that we have been making a category mistake about the mind for a long time by applying idioms and descriptions of physical things to mental things, i.e. ascribe existence and causal properties to the mind.

Example: Construe mental conduct words, such as desires and intentions, as signifying non-mechanical processes. Represent minds as extra centers of causal processes.

Another Example:
"He built a house" vs. "He built a fantasy"
The latter describes a sequence of private events in a private space invoking mental arrangements. This talk leads to thinking that the mind is a spiritual thing with non-physical mental objects.

Other examples of category mistakes that the dualist makes:

1. Construe mental conduct words, such as desires and intentions, as signifying non-mechanical processes.
1. Represent minds as extra center of causal processes.
1. Represent minds as substantive entities.

## Soft Behaviorism

**All**  words and descriptions get their meaning from the circumstances in which we know it is correct to apply them. These "criterial conditions" for words to have meaning must be public, physical events. They cannot be private events, since there would then be no common understanding fo the terms. There are no criterial conditions for private meanings. If we invoke terms that we allege to have some private criterial content, we are speaking nonsense.

Ryle: Mind talk is really talk about our behavior and dispositions to behave and not talk about some inner ghostly entity.

We can fully describe what is happening when, for example, pains occur by using languages that refers only to the behavior or dispositions to behave of people suffering.

Mind/body problem is a confusion.

### Behaviorism and Other Minds

There is no "problem of other minds". There is no longer a problem of how we can know whether a non-physical, spiritual thing is present or absent in other bodies. All we need to know is whether other people behave or are disposed to behave in the ways in which the mental terms apply,
